# Stock-Recommendations
Machine Learning and Data Mining

The aim of the project is to recommend the stocks to individuals based on the
performance of different stocks. This dataset is gathered from Kaggle. I have included
an overview of a data set that has various traits of global companies that are listed on
the stock exchange in this report. This information assists millions of investors in
determining where to place their money. We take a look at stock market performance
for thousands of companies which provides directions on how to go about
investment strategies and helps know the market trends.

In this I have included Dataset, exploratory data analysis on data by analyzing 
the relationship between data variables, classification models, evaluation results of 
that models and end with the conclusion by recommending stocks.
